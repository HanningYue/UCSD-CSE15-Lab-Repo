What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?

>MacOS, Visual Studio Code, VSCode terminal

Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.

>I expect the FileProcessor to create a output.txt file with the reversed version of each line from input.txt. However, no output.txt file is created, and there's no error message. 

Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.
